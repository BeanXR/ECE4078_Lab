# ECE4078 Lab
For lab sessions of unit ECE4078 (Intelligent Robotics)

## Instructions
Please see each folder for every week's detailed instrcutions and getting-started codes

## Format
Due to restricted access to the campus, you will be doing the implementation and testing inside the simulator environment. 

Starting from week 2, before each week's lab sessions, the instructions and getting-started codes will be made available to you in this GitHub repo. During each 3-hour lab session, you will get an overview of each week's objectives at the beginning of the lab session. At least one demonstrator will be reachable through Zoom to support you during the whole session. In the final 30 minutes of the lab session, the demonstrator will either show a sample solution or one of your solutions in the simulator or on the physcial robot if possible, and you can view it through the shared screen and the webcam. 

You will work together with two of your classmates as a group of 3 throughout the semester. Your group's performance will be evaluated in the simulator environment and everyone in the group will receive the same mark.
