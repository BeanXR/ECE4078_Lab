# ECE4078
For lab sessions of unit ECE4078 (Intelligent Robotics)

## Instructions
Please see each folder for every week's detailed instrcutions and getting-started codes

## Format
Due to restricted access to the campus, you will be doing most of the implementation and testing inside the simulator environment. 
Starting from week 2, during each 3-hour lab session, you can submit your codes that were already tested in the simulator to the demonstrator. (S)he will load your code on the physcial robot. You can view and control the robot through the shared screen and the webcam. You will have 10 minutes with the physcial robot before another group takes their turn. 
Your performance will be marked as the average of your score in the simulator and on the physical robot.
