# ECE4078 Lab
For lab sessions of unit ECE4078 (Intelligent Robotics)

## Instructions
Please see each folder for every week's detailed instrcutions and getting-started codes

## Format
Due to restricted access to the campus, you will be doing the implementation and testing inside the simulator environment. 
Starting from week 2, during each 3-hour lab session, at least one demonstrator will be reachable through Zoom to support you. During the final 30 minutes of the lab session, the demonstrator will either load a sample solution or one of your solutions onto the physcial robot, and you can view the execution on the robot through the shared screen and the webcam. 
You will work together as a group with two of your classmates. Your group's performance will be evaluated in the simulator environment.
